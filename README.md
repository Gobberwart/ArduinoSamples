Small Arduino sketches that demonstrate simple concepts.

This repository contains a bunch of very small and simple Arduino sketches I've created to test various components and functions.

None of it is likely to be documented, and most of it is utterly pointless, but it may be useful for my future reference, and for anyone else looking for help.
